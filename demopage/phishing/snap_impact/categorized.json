Activity to this site occurs in a brief period of this sample where we believe a new website or page is being loaded. Moreover, the traffic from this site leads us to believe that it was the site that was actually loaded (for example, through a link click). This could be more interesting. There are at least 2 sessions to this destination. At least 1 MB has been downloaded from this destination. As this number increases, it becomes more likely that this is a download of significant raw data, a document, or an application. This likely warrants more attention.  Our OSINT analysis, which we've interpreted as identifying the site as a Benign Semi-Popular Site, mostly agrees. Additional details are as follows. This site appeared in 1 lists that are curated to capture commonly-seen activity that erroneously ends up triggering common techniques used to identify malicious behavior:\n1. Top 20 000 websites from Cisco Umbrella\n\nIf there is Malicious or Suspicious activity in this sample, this site may be the way that behavior was hosted and served to the user.",
