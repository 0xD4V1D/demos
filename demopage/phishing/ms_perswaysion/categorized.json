This site was active for a relatively long period of time, but it didn't seem to be something that a user actively interacted with.

Second, it occurs when they are visiting the login page. If an authenticated session appears nearby, it likely means that the user has just authenticated (and an event will be visible).

This site was active for a relatively long period of time, but it didn't seem to be something that a user actively interacted with. This could mean that it is background activity on a site (such as tracking, analytics, or assets loading), or is some operating system functionality.  Our OSINT analysis, which we've interpreted as identifying the site as a Benign Semi-Popular Site, mostly agrees. Additional details are as follows. This site appeared in 3 lists that are curated to capture commonly-seen activity that erroneously ends up triggering common techniques used to identify malicious behavior:\n1. Top 20 000 websites from Cisco Umbrella\n2. Top 10 000 websites from Cisco Umbrella\n3. Top 5000 websites from Cisco Umbrella\n\nThis site was approximately 3 years old when first seen. While there are attackers who explicitly age their domains to avoid detection, the majority of older domains are uninteresting (from a security perspective). If this site seems to have just become active recently, is near highly suspicious activity (such as login portals or known Impacts), or other information provided points to its maliciousness, then it could be something to dig deeper into. However, if not, it may simply be background infrastructure for a site.",
