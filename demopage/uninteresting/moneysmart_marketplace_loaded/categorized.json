Activity to this site occurs in a brief period of this sample where we believe a new website or page is being loaded. Moreover, the traffic from this site leads us to believe that it was the site that was actually loaded (for example, through a link click). This could be more interesting. There are at least 5 sessions to this destination. This could mean that this destination is important in this sample. At least 1 MB has been downloaded from this destination. As this number increases, it becomes more likely that this is a download of significant raw data, a document, or an application. This likely warrants more attention. 1022.26 KB was downloaded from this destination. Usually that amount of data is associated with  an application being downloaded. If this is occurring from an unexpected site, it could be malicious. This site was active for a relatively long period of time. This could mean that someone was browsing the site, or it may indicate a connection that is continuously loading something in the background.  Our OSINT analysis, which we've interpreted as identifying the site as a Likely Benign Generic Benign Site, mostly agrees. Additional details are as follows. There are 47 total results for this site, which is a relatively low number to see when searching the Internet for a specific site. This can indicate that the site is not well known. However, we've noticed that the matches that are security relevant are few in number, and most of the results point to this being a legitimate site. The top results for this site are:\n\t1.

Our OSINT analysis, which we've interpreted as identifying the site as a Benign Semi-Popular Site, agrees. Additional details are as follows. This site appeared in 5 lists that are curated to capture commonly-seen activity that erroneously ends up triggering common techniques used to identify malicious behavior:\n1. Top 20 000 websites from Cisco Umbrella\n2. Top 10 000 websites from Cisco Umbrella\n3. Top 10K most-used sites from Tranco\n4. Top 1,000,000 most-used sites from Tranco\n5. Top 10K websites from Majestic Million\n\nThis site was approximately 17 years old when first seen. While there are attackers who explicitly age their domains to avoid detection, the majority of older domains are uninteresting (from a security perspective). If this site seems to have just become active recently, is near highly suspicious activity (such as login portals or known Impacts), or other information provided points to its maliciousness, then it could be something to dig deeper into. However, if not, it may simply be background infrastructure for a site.",
