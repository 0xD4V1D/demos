This could mean that this destination is important in this sample. At least 1 MB has been downloaded from this destination. As this number increases, it becomes more likely that this is a download of significant raw data, a document, or an application. This likely warrants more attention. This site was active for a relatively long period of time. This could mean that someone was browsing the site, or it may indicate a connection that is continuously loading something in the background.  Our OSINT analysis, which we've interpreted as identifying the site as a Benign Semi-Popular Site, mostly agrees. Additional details are as follows. This site appeared in 2 lists that are curated to capture commonly-seen activity that erroneously ends up triggering common techniques used to identify malicious behavior:\n1. Top 20 000 websites from Cisco Umbrella\n2. Top 10 000 websites from Cisco Umbrella\n\nIf there is Malicious or Suspicious activity in this sample, this site may be the way that behavior was hosted and served to the user.",
