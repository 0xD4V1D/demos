Activity to this site occurs in a brief period of this sample where we believe a new website or page is being loaded. Moreover, the traffic from this site leads us to believe that it was the site that was actually loaded (for example, through a link click). This could be more interesting. There are at least 5 sessions to this destination. This could mean that this destination is important in this sample. At least 1 MB has been downloaded from this destination. As this number increases, it becomes more likely that this is a download of significant raw data, a document, or an application. This likely warrants more attention. Based on the activity in this sample, it looks as though this site also has a form loading. This could be a form asking for credentials, for address and payment information, or for some other data that the user is expected to input.  Our OSINT analysis, which we've interpreted as identifying the site as a Benign Common Site, mostly agrees. Additional details are as follows. There are 189 total results for this site, which is a relatively low number to see when searching the Internet for a specific site. This can indicate that the site is not well known. There were no results that indicated that this site has been analyzed in security tools, which strongly suggests that this site is uninteresting from a security perspective. \n",

This site appeared in 3 lists that are curated to capture commonly-seen activity that erroneously ends up triggering common techniques used to identify malicious behavior:\n1. Top 20 000 websites from Cisco Umbrella\n2. Top 10 000 websites from Cisco Umbrella\n3. Top 5000 websites from Cisco Umbrella\n\nThis site was approximately 26 years old when first seen. While there are attackers who explicitly age their domains to avoid detection, the majority of older domains are uninteresting (from a security perspective). If this site seems to have just become active recently, is near highly suspicious activity (such as login portals or known Impacts), or other information provided points to its maliciousness, then it could be something to dig deeper into.
