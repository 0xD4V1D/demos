There are at least 5 sessions to this destination. This could mean that this destination is important in this sample.  Our OSINT analysis, which we've interpreted as identifying the site as a Benign Semi-Popular Site, mostly agrees. Additional details are as follows. This site appeared in 3 lists that are curated to capture commonly-seen activity that erroneously ends up triggering common techniques used to identify malicious behavior:\n1. known Windows 10 connection endpoints\n2.

Activity to this site occurs in a brief period of this sample where we believe a new website or page is being loaded. Moreover, the traffic from this site leads us to believe that it was the site that was actually loaded (for example, through a link click). This could be more interesting. There are at least 5 sessions to this destination. This could mean that this destination is important in this sample. In this sample, there were 20 unclassified activities to this site. This is unusual. At least 1 MB has been downloaded from this destination. As this number increases, it becomes more likely that this is a download of significant raw data, a document, or an application. This likely warrants more attention. Based on the activity in this sample, it looks as though this site also has a form loading. This could be a form asking for credentials, for address and payment information, or for some other data that the user is expected to input. This site was active for a relatively long period of time. This could mean that someone was browsing the site, or it may indicate a connection that is continuously loading something in the background.  Our OSINT analysis, which we've interpreted as identifying the site as a Benign Semi-Popular Site, mostly agrees. Additional details are as follows. This site appeared in 4 lists that are curated to capture commonly-seen activity that erroneously ends up triggering common techniques used to identify malicious behavior:\n1. University domains\n2. Top 10K most-used sites from Tranco\n3. Top 1,000,000 most-used sites from Tranco\n4. Top 10K websites from Majestic Million\n\nIf there is Malicious or Suspicious activity in this sample, this site may be the way that behavior was hosted and served to the user.",

Activity to this site occurs in a brief period of this sample where we believe a new website or page is being loaded. Moreover, the traffic from this site leads us to believe that it was the site that was actually loaded (for example, through a link click). This could be more interesting. There are at least 5 sessions to this destination. This could mean that this destination is important in this sample. At least 1 MB has been downloaded from this destination. As this number increases, it becomes more likely that this is a download of significant raw data, a document, or an application. This likely warrants more attention. 9.92 MB was downloaded from this destination in a very short amount of time. This increases the chance that this is a download to look into, especially if the site is not well-known or is nearby other Suspicious or Malicious activity.  This site was active for a relatively long period of time. This could mean that someone was browsing the site, or it may indicate a connection that is continuously loading something in the background.  Our OSINT analysis, which we've interpreted as identifying the site as a Benign Semi-Popular Site, mostly agrees. Additional details are as follows. This site appeared in 4 lists that are curated to capture commonly-seen activity that erroneously ends up triggering common techniques used to identify malicious behavior:\n1. known Windows 10 connection endpoints\n2. Top 20 000 websites from Cisco Umbrella\n3. Top 10 000 websites from Cisco Umbrella\n4. Top 5000 websites from Cisco Umbrella\n\nIf there is Malicious or Suspicious activity in this sample, this site may be the way that behavior was hosted and served to the user.",

Activity to this site occurs in a brief period of this sample where we believe a new website or page is being loaded. Moreover, the traffic from this site leads us to believe that it was the site that was actually loaded (for example, through a link click). This could be more interesting. There are at least 2 sessions to this destination. This site was active for a relatively long period of time. This could mean that someone was browsing the site, or it may indicate a connection that is continuously loading something in the background.  Our OSINT analysis, which we've interpreted as identifying the site as a Benign Semi-Popular Site, mostly agrees. Additional details are as follows. This site appeared in 4 lists that are curated to capture commonly-seen activity that erroneously ends up triggering common techniques used to identify malicious behavior:\n1. known Windows 10 connection endpoints\n2.
