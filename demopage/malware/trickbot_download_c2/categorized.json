At this point, it doesn't resolve to an IP address, which is extremely suspicious. Sites that are not threats generally don't lose their IP addresses. Here is more information for you to review. The activity in this sample indicates the following. Activity to this site occurs in a brief period of this sample where we believe a new website or page is being loaded. Moreover, the traffic from this site leads us to believe that it was the site that was actually loaded (for example, through a link click). This could be more interesting.  Our Internet search results say the following. Only 4 results, which is an extremely low number. This either indicates that the site is wildly unpopular (and therefore probably uninteresting) or it is a potentially unknown security threat. The results that most strongly indicated that this was a security threat have the following title snippets:\n\t1. iocs/domains.txt at main \u00b7 hpthreatresearch/iocs \u00b7 GitHub\n",
