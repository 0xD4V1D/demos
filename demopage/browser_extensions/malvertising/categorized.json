This site was approximately 4 years old when first seen. While there are attackers who explicitly age their domains to avoid detection, the majority of older domains are uninteresting (from a security perspective). If this site seems to have just become active recently, is near highly suspicious activity (such as login portals or known Impacts), or other information provided points to its maliciousness, then it could be something to dig deeper into. However, if not, it may simply be background infrastructure for a site. Here is more information for you to review. The activity in this sample indicates the following. There are at least 5 sessions to this destination. This could mean that this destination is important in this sample. This site was active for a relatively long period of time, but it didn't seem to be something that a user actively interacted with. This could mean that it is background activity on a site (such as tracking, analytics, or assets loading), or is some operating system functionality.  Our Internet search results say the following. Only 4 results, which is an extremely low number. This either indicates that the site is wildly unpopular (and therefore probably uninteresting) or it is a potentially unknown security threat.

A C2-like channel exists and has sent at least 1KB, which is an amount great enough to arouse suspicion. There are at least 5 sessions to this destination.

However, our Internet search results (which we've interpreted as identifying the site as a Potentially Malicious Generic Malicious Site with confidence of 6/10) don't generally agree. We believe this to be true because this site is likely not something that an end user would be looking for, which skews our analysis towards believing that it may be a problem.

This site was approximately 2 years old when first seen. While there are attackers who explicitly age their domains to avoid detection, the majority of older domains are uninteresting (from a security perspective). If this site seems to have just become active recently, is near highly suspicious activity (such as login portals or known Impacts), or other information provided points to its maliciousness, then it could be something to dig deeper into. However, if not, it may simply be background infrastructure for a site. Here is more information for you to review. The activity in this sample indicates the following. There are at least 2 sessions to this destination.  Our Internet search results say the following. No results when searched, which is highly suspicious. ",

Activity to this site occurs in a brief period of this sample where we believe a new website or page is being loaded. Moreover, the traffic from this site leads us to believe that it was the site that was actually loaded (for example, through a link click). This could be more interesting. There are at least 2 sessions to this destination. This site was active for a relatively long period of time. This could mean that someone was browsing the site, or it may indicate a connection that is continuously loading something in the background.  However, our Internet search results (which we've interpreted as identifying the site as a Potentially Malicious Generic Malicious Site with confidence of 6/10) don't generally agree. We believe this to be true because this site is likely not something that an end user would be looking for, which skews our analysis towards believing that it may be a problem. There are 176 total results for this site, which is a relatively low number to see when searching the Internet for a specific site. This can indicate that the site is not well known. The results that most strongly indicated that this was a security threat have the following title snippets:\n\t1. 192.243.59.13 Threat Intelligence and Host Information\n\t2. IP > 192.243.59.13 | Threatcrowd.org Open Source Threat Intelligence\n\t3. dns-community-blacklist/adguarddns.dns at master \u00b7 NethServer/dns ...\n\t4. adfilt/Dandelion Sprout's Anti-Malware List.txt at master ...\n\t5. adfilt/AntiMalwareHosts.txt at master \u00b7 DandelionSprout/adfilt \u00b7 GitHub\nThe first result that suggests this may be a threat is actually the first overall search result, though there are (relatively speaking) many search results.

Here is more information for you to review. The activity in this sample indicates the following. There are at least 2 sessions to this destination. This site was active for a relatively long period of time, but it didn't seem to be something that a user actively interacted with. This could mean that it is background activity on a site (such as tracking, analytics, or assets loading), or is some operating system functionality.  Our Internet search results say the following. Only 1 results, which is an extremely low number. This either indicates that the site is wildly unpopular (and therefore probably uninteresting) or it is a potentially unknown security threat. The results that most strongly indicated that this was a security threat have the following title snippets:\n\t1. http://clk.rtpdn15.com/click?i=2yc8IIv5uhU_0. | ANY.RUN - ANY.RUN\nThe first result that suggests this may be a threat is actually the first and only search result, which is highly interesting.",

Activity to this site occurs in a brief period of this sample where we believe a new website or page is being loaded.

There are at least 5 sessions to this destination. This could mean that this destination is important in this sample. Based on the activity in this sample, it looks as though this site also has a form loading. This could be a form asking for credentials, for address and payment information, or for some other data that the user is expected to input. This site was active for a relatively long period of time. This could mean that someone was browsing the site, or it may indicate a connection that is continuously loading something in the background.

This could mean that this destination is important in this sample. This site was active for a relatively long period of time, but it didn't seem to be something that a user actively interacted with. This could mean that it is background activity on a site (such as tracking, analytics, or assets loading), or is some operating system functionality.  Our OSINT analysis, which we've interpreted as identifying the site as a Benign Common Site, mostly agrees. Additional details are as follows. There are 21 total results for this site, which is a relatively low number to see when searching the Internet for a specific site. This can indicate that the site is not well known. There were no results that indicated that this site has been analyzed in security tools, which strongly suggests that this site is uninteresting from a security perspective. \nThis site was approximately 38 weeks old when first seen. There are many sites that fall into this age range. Focusing on the activity surrounding this site (especially if there are known Attack Vectors or Impacts) is likely the best way to understand if it is interesting if other information provided does not help to clarify its role.",

This could mean that it is background activity on a site (such as tracking, analytics, or assets loading), or is some operating system functionality.  Our OSINT analysis, which we've interpreted as identifying the site as a Benign Known site, mostly agrees. Additional details are as follows. This site appeared in 1 lists that are curated to capture commonly-seen activity that erroneously ends up triggering common techniques used to identify malicious behavior:\n1. Top 1,000,000 most-used sites from Tranco\n\nThis site was approximately 38 weeks old when first seen. There are many sites that fall into this age range.

Our OSINT analysis, which we've interpreted as identifying the site as a Benign Semi-Popular Site, agrees. Additional details are as follows. This site appeared in 5 lists that are curated to capture commonly-seen activity that erroneously ends up triggering common techniques used to identify malicious behavior:\n1. Top 20 000 websites from Cisco Umbrella\n2. Top 10 000 websites from Cisco Umbrella\n3. Top 10K most-used sites from Tranco\n4. Top 5000 websites from Cisco Umbrella\n5. Top 1,000,000 most-used sites from Tranco\n\nThis site was approximately 4 years old when first seen. While there are attackers who explicitly age their domains to avoid detection, the majority of older domains are uninteresting (from a security perspective). If this site seems to have just become active recently, is near highly suspicious activity (such as login portals or known Impacts), or other information provided points to its maliciousness, then it could be something to dig deeper into. However, if not, it may simply be background infrastructure for a site.",
