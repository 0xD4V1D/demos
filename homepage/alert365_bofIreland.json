Activity to this site occurs in a brief period of this sample where we believe a new website or page is being loaded. Moreover, the traffic from this site leads us to believe that it was the site that was actually loaded (for example, through a link click). This could be more interesting. There are at least 2 sessions to this destination. This site was active for a relatively long period of time. This could mean that someone was browsing the site, or it may indicate a connection that is continuously loading something in the background.  In addition, Internet search results agree. Only 1 results, which is an extremely low number. This either indicates that the site is wildly unpopular (and therefore probably uninteresting) or it is a potentially unknown security threat. The results that most strongly indicated that this was a security threat have the following title snippets:\n\t1. NetworkSage (@myNetworkSage) / Twitter --> KNOWN MALICIOUS match\nThe first result that suggests this may be a threat is actually the first and only search result, which is highly interesting.\nThis site was just 22 hours old when first seen. Common reasons for seeing activity to very new sites include an attack (such as phishing), a site related to the debut of something new (a movie, a service, a business), use of a VPN (which constantly use new domains to bypass blocklists), or analytics/tracking sites (for similar reasons to VPNs).",

This could mean that this destination is important in this sample. This site was active for a relatively long period of time, but it didn't seem to be something that a user actively interacted with. This could mean that it is background activity on a site (such as tracking, analytics, or assets loading), or is some operating system functionality.  Our OSINT analysis, which we've interpreted as identifying the site as a Benign Semi-Popular Site, mostly agrees. Additional details are as follows. This site appeared in 3 lists that are curated to capture commonly-seen activity that erroneously ends up triggering common techniques used to identify malicious behavior:\n1. Top 20 000 websites from Cisco Umbrella\n2. Top 10 000 websites from Cisco Umbrella\n3. Top 5000 websites from Cisco Umbrella\n\nThis site was approximately 9 years old when first seen. While there are attackers who explicitly age their domains to avoid detection, the majority of older domains are uninteresting (from a security perspective). If this site seems to have just become active recently, is near highly suspicious activity (such as login portals or known Impacts), or other information provided points to its maliciousness, then it could be something to dig deeper into. However, if not, it may simply be background infrastructure for a site.",

This site was active for a relatively long period of time, but it didn't seem to be something that a user actively interacted with. This could mean that it is background activity on a site (such as tracking, analytics, or assets loading), or is some operating system functionality.  Our OSINT analysis, which we've interpreted as identifying the site as a Benign Semi-Popular Site, agrees. Additional details are as follows. This site appeared in 3 lists that are curated to capture commonly-seen activity that erroneously ends up triggering common techniques used to identify malicious behavior:\n1. Top 20 000 websites from Cisco Umbrella\n2. Top 10 000 websites from Cisco Umbrella\n3. Top 5000 websites from Cisco Umbrella\n\nThis site was approximately 20 years old when first seen. While there are attackers who explicitly age their domains to avoid detection, the majority of older domains are uninteresting (from a security perspective). If this site seems to have just become active recently, is near highly suspicious activity (such as login portals or known Impacts), or other information provided points to its maliciousness, then it could be something to dig deeper into. However, if not, it may simply be background infrastructure for a site.",
